class_name GameKernel
extends Node

## The core kernel: stable infrastructure the whole game and all modules build on.
##
## Registered as the "Kernel" autoload, so it is reachable globally as `Kernel`.
## (The script is named [GameKernel] to avoid colliding with the autoload's own name.)
## It boots its subsystems in a deterministic order — each only depends on ones already
## constructed — then loads modules, which register their content through these seams.
## The kernel deliberately contains NO gameplay/DLC logic.
